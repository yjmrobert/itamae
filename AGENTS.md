## Documentation Maintenance

*   **Update Documentation:** Whenever you make changes to the code (adding features, changing behaviors, or updating installation steps), you **MUST** verify if the documentation needs to be updated.
*   **Docs Location:** The documentation is located in the `docs/` directory and is a Hugo-based static site.
*   **Source of Truth:** While `README.md` and other root markdown files exist, the `docs/content/` directory should be considered the primary source for the documentation website. If you update root markdown files, ensure the corresponding files in `docs/content/` are also updated.
